        <p>In the beginning there was nothing and then everything. Color filled the black cold nothing nothingness
of space, and with that color there was one thing, a thing that holds power, power everyone wants.
This thing is not this force of nature,  but a crystal-like rock light pink or magenta in color. This crystal-like rock floated
in space for thousands of millions of years waiting in a deep sleep Unit, it hit earth. Covered in rocks and ice it hit the earth
65,000,000 years ago, starting an ice age with its impact and, for millions it slept to be awakened.
Unit, it was in the year 200 it was found in thousands layers of stone smaller but powerful if used correctly can create and destroy
the crystal is so powerful that it can make anyone the most powerful man in the UNIVERSE.The crystal was passed
down throughtout generations to father to son, mother to daughter, "the powerful family in the world" the people would say
but they didn't know the truth about why they were so powerful, they were so powerful because they shared their power equality
to everyone in their family. They didn't know one thing about the crystal it could copy anything the crystal could look
like anyone or anything, the crystal gained knowledge of the millions of years and it Never Forgot it heard everything and it knew things
things no man should know the crystal has gained so much but also lost so much POWER, the power that was stolen for it
and for that reason it's anger grows. And one day it stopped waiting, then the family shared the power the crystal had a plan
and the plan was to take their blood in their body's and expland it and heat to make them POP like h̷͎͍̋e̴͖͠ has seen before by many of their family
has done to many others before. And then h̷͎͍̋e̴͖͠ thought h̷͎͍̋e̴͖͠ won, a loud group of people laughing walks in the room, it no, h̷͎͍̋e̴͖͠ thought this will be the end
for them but, no it wasn't they hid and used copies to fake their own deaths and now they knew that it-h̷͎͍̋e̴͖͠ was too powerful and then. They didn't exist
h̷͎͍̋e̴͖͠ was so powerful that it made them stop existing, and this was just the beginning. "End of a story.
